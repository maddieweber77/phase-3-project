#! If I type in the uncapitalized name of a neighborhood, it should still accept it
    
#! make some random function that is randomly either true / false (to recreate a second bidder) and depending what it returns, the original user will either be outbid (or will be allowed to have the reservation)
    
#! Needs to ask the user for party size
    

#! Make tests for first and last name
    
#! downplay the login info
#! rather, need to emphasize bidding process:
    # pull restaurants API

#! if there aren't any restaurant reservations with the specific inputted # of people, we need to tell them that and ask them if they would like to look elsewhere

#! Need to make it so that you enter a number to pick the restaurant as well
